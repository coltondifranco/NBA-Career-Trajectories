# NBA Player Career Trajectory Analysis

This project explores the career trajectories of NBA players using a relational database, SQL querying, and Microsoft Excel for statistical analysis and visualization. The goal was to understand how player performance and longevity vary by position and evolve over time.

### The process included:

Data Cleaning: Standardizing string values, removing irrelevant or duplicate entries, handling nulls, and filtering the dataset to include players and games from 2005 onward for modern relevance.

Database Transformation: Creating a new consolidated table that captures season-level average statistics for each player, combining information from four original tables through SQL joins and aggregations.

Querying and Exporting: Writing SQL queries to explore trends in player longevity and statistical performance over time and by position. The results were exported as CSV files.

Analysis in Excel: Fitting polynomial models to visualize and interpret trends in statistics like points, assists, rebounds, minutes, and more as a function of a player’s years in the league.

### Key insights include:

Centers tend to have longer average careers than guards and forwards.

Most performance metrics peak around year 9–10 of a player’s career, though the average career only lasts about 5 years. This is due to the fact that only elite performing players make it this late into their careers.

Guards generally play more minutes and have higher scoring and assist metrics, but may also face earlier physical decline.

### Major SQL queries, visualizations, and summary data are included. This project demonstrates data cleaning, relational database manipulation, and data analysis skills using real-world sports data.
